The roadway condition was allegedly wet due to heavy rain that just subsided to a light drizzle.
While approaching a Lincoln vehicle with the Highway Drive Assist (""HDA"") engaged, the operator alleged the following:
1) The operator decided to actively brake to disengage the HDA mode.  
2) The operator then switched to the right lane successfully.
3) The vehicle's Lane Keep Assist (""LKA"") applied steering input during the lane change while the operator manually managed the steering completing the lane change.
4) Within a few seconds of the lane change, the vehicle began to rotate counter-clockwise and the front of the vehicle made contact with the rear passenger side of the Lincoln vehicle in the left lane.
5) After making contact, the GV70 rotated clockwise and travelled off the roadway eventually coming to a stop in a wooded area.  The Lincoln vehicle also left the roadway and came to a stop near the GV70 vehicle in the same wooded area.
6) The GV70 vehicle airbags did not deploy during the incident.
7) Police and first responder medical teams arrived at the incident and the GV70 car was towed away.
HMA, HATCI, and NHTSA's SCI inspected the vehicle on June [XXX], 2022. An EDR event record was downloaded. The EDR report indicated the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) was not engaged within the 5 seconds recorded prior to the crash event. A copy of the EDR report was retained by SCI. Because ACC is a mandatory component of the vehicle's HDA function, the inactive state of the ACC in the EDR report inferred that the HDA was not engaged at the time of crash.  A follow-up interview with the vehicle operator was held with members from HMA, HATCI, and NHTSA's SCI.  Details obtained during the interview confirmed that neither HDA, nor any other of the vehicle's equipped Level 2 ADAS functionality, was engaged at the time of the crash.

The roadway condition was wet due to heavy rain that just subsided to a light drizzle. 
While approaching a Lincoln vehicle with the Highway Drive Assist (""HDA"") engaged:
1) The operator decided to actively brake to disengage the HDA mode.  
2) The operator then switched to the right lane successfully.
3) The vehicle's Lane Keep Assist (""LKA"") applied steering input during the lane change while the operator manually managed the steering completing the lane change.
4) Within a few seconds of the lane change, the vehicle began to rotate counter-clockwise and the front of the vehicle made contact with the rear passenger side of the Lincoln vehicle in the left lane.
5) After making contact, the GV70 rotated clockwise and travelled off the roadway eventually coming to a stop in a wooded area.  The Lincoln vehicle also left the roadway and came to a stop near the GV70 vehicle in the same wooded area.
6) The GV70 vehicle airbags did not deploy during the incident.
7) Police and first responder medical teams arrived at the incident and the GV70 car was towed away.
HMA and HATCI are actively investigating this incident and are planning to inspect the GV70 vehicle.  An EDR download will be attempted."," "

Customer reported her husband was driving the subject Telluride at 65mph through a toll southbound on [XXX] when a second vehicle behind the Telluride went through the toll and attempted to squeeze in between the Telluride and a third vehicle on the highway. Customer's husband moved the Telluride to the right to evade the second vehicle and made contact with the right shoulder guardrail.  No other vehicles were involved in the incident.  The vehicle was towed.  When asked by CA, the customer reported that HDA and cruise control were engaged at the time of the incident but customer did not allege that either of those systems caused the accident.

The vehicle was decelerating in heavy traffic on northbound [XXX] in Phoenix, AZ, and, while traveling at approximately 7mph, was rear-ended by a Chevrolet Malibu that was traveling at a high rate of speed.  The impact caused front end damage to the Malibu, and rear end damage to the Audi, and also pushed the Audi into a BMW Z4, causing minor front end damage to the Audi, and minor rear end damage to the BMW.  EDR data retrieved from the Audi indicate that ADAS systems were not active at the time that it was rear-ended by the Chevrolet.  The driver of the Audi was belted, and the airbag did not deploy.  There were no injuries, but the damage to the Audi was severe enough that towaway was necessary.  This incident was part of a multi-car collision, involving five vehicles in total the Audi came into contact with two of those vehicles (Chevrolet and BMW).  Because the EDR data indicates that ADAS systems were not active at the time of the incident and the Audi vehicle appears to have performed as designed, VWGoA has no plans for further investigation and considers this matter closed."," "

The customer did indicate the Highway Drive Assist mode was on.  The customer alleges that the vehicle left the lane of travel when driving a steep curved road, initiating a crash.  Hyundai notes that the ODD of the Highway Drive Assist system is limited by certain environmental factors, such as weather and curvatures in the path of travel, requiring the driver to remain engaged at all times while operating the vehicle.  Hyundai is attempting to gather additional details on the incident for a possible vehicle inspection. 
*10-Day Update*
Hyundai is attempting to inspect the incident vehicle and download the EDR report for further analysis.
*Monthly Update #1*
Hyundai inspected the vehicle on October [XXX], 2021. The inspection and associated EDR report is currently under review.  The results and assessment will be provided in the next monthly update and in the next monthly ""deep dive"" discussion with ODI.
*Monthly Update #2 - Final assessment*
Hyundai reviewed the traffic report and deduced that HDA could not have been engaged during the incident. HDA is only available for approved highways such as federal interstates. Hyundai also reviewed the EDR report and confirmed the driver entered the turn with Smart Cruise Control (""SCC"") engaged at a set speed of 80 mph. The accelerator pedal was depressed throughout the event. The brake pedal was never depressed. Lane Following Assist (""LFA"") engagement could not be confirmed however, a manual steering maneuver was performed approximately 2 seconds prior to the incident and the ESC engaged, indicating a vehicle slip.  Hyundai deduced that the operator could have entered the turn at a high speed, realizing that the vehicle may not be able steer itself through the curve, and performed a significant steering maneuver in an attempt to center the vehicle within the lane, causing the vehicle to lose control. 
Hyundai notes that the HDA/LFA/SCC systems are not Level 2+ systems and are not designed nor marketed to provide complete ""hands-free"" driving to the operator. Drivers must be ready at all times with their hands on the wheel to insert themselves into a manual driving task. Hyundai has implemented driver attention warning systems that alert drivers up to 3 consecutive times if hands are not detected on the steering wheel for a brief period of time."," "

The customer alleged being in an accident, said thanks for saving his life, but also alleged that the lane trace assist failed. Customer stated that he was using cruise control at the time of the accident and does not remember the cruise control speed (but mentioned driving at the speed limit or 10% over the speed limit during the call). The customer alleged that there was sudden down pour of rain and should not have had the cruise control on, and could have been driving safer, but expected the lane trace to have performed better. The customer stated he was using his thumb to decrease the cruise control speed and believes he drove over a large puddle of water and possibly a pothole. The customer also stated that lanes were not detected and the lane tracing assist malfunctioned, causing the vehicle to hydroplane and drift. He reported that the vehicle hit 2-7 trees before coming to a stop. He stated the driver airbag deployed, saving his life, and the driver side seat airbag and driver curtain shield airbags also deployed. He alleges sustaining whiplash, bruising lower abdomen, left knee contusion, cut on left forearm and psychologic stress from the incident. He declined to go to the hospital at the time of the crash but did get a CT scan two days after the crash, which he stated revealed no brain injuries.

The customer alleged being in an accident, said thanks for saving his life, but also alleged that the lane trace assist failed. Customer stated that he was using cruise control at the time of the accident and does not remember the cruise control speed (but mentioned driving at the speed limit or 10% over the speed limit during the call). The customer alleged that there was sudden down pour of rain and should not have had the cruise control on, and could have been driving safer, but expected the lane trace to have performed better. The customer stated he was using his thumb to decrease the cruise control speed and believes he drove over a large puddle of water and possibly a pothole. The customer also stated that lanes were not detected and the lane tracing assist malfunctioned, causing the vehicle to hydroplane and drift. He reported that the vehicle hit 2-7 trees before coming to a stop. He stated the driver airbag deployed, saving his life, and the driver side seat airbag and driver curtain shield airbags also deployed. He alleges sustaining whiplash, bruising lower abdomen, left knee contusion, cut on left forearm and psychologic stress from the incident. He declined to go to the hospital at the time of the crash but did get a CT scan two days after the crash, which he stated revealed no brain injuries."," "
