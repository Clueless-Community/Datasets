Christos KARAVELAS,Greece,Greece,Money Laundering,Money laundering,,,,Male,Free,"Examining magistrates investigating the Siemens kickbacks case on Wednesday issued arrest warrants for former Siemens Hellas executives Mihalis Christoforakos and Christos Karavelas. The warrants were issued chiefly as a formality in order to declare the investigation completed, appeals court sources said. The case concerns a contract signed in 1997 between the then state-run Greek telecoms company OTE and Siemens for the digitisation of OTE's switching centres. During an investigation into possible kickbacks paid to Greek state officials so that Siemens would be awarded state contracts, the magistrates found payments linked to the OTE contract in which the two former Siemens executives are implicated. In order to officially declare the end of the investigation on this aspect of the case, they therefore had to summons Christoforakos and Karavelas to testify and then issue arrest warrants. Both men are currently outside Greece, having fled in 2009 after they were summoned to testify. Karavelas is believed to be in Uruguay and Christoforakos, who had both Greek and German passports, fled to Germany and has remained there since a local court ruled, in November 2009, that under German law the statutes related to his offences have expired and he cannot be extradited to Greece to stand trial",2011,,,
