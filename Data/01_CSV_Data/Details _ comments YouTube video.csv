from sklearn import preprocessing, svm
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import quandl
import math

# We're using quandl.com as our data source.  We're going to get the stock information for Google 
# and use it for our regression example. 
stock_df = quandl.get('WIKI/GOOGL')

# We need to figure out what features of this data set to use for our stock price prediction.
# We'll choose only somewhat relevant features, in this case the Adjusted open, Adjusted close,
# The adjusted high and low stock price, the Adjusted close and the Adjusted volume. 
# Note that 'Adjusted' simply means the price of the stock after such things as  stock splits. 
# We could use the non-adjusted features as well, but using both adjusted and non-adjusted is 
# not useful as they both essentially describe the same things. 

stock_df = stock_df[['Adj. Open','Adj. High','Adj. Low','Adj. Close','Adj. Volume']]


# Here, we're going to create two new features computed from the features already given 
# in the data set.  # We're going to need these features to track volatility in the stock
# which is an essential feature for predicting a new stock price. 

#The first features is the high low percentage, calculated by subtracting the
# adjusted high price from the close and dividing by the close multiplied by 100.0 (to get a proper percentage value)
#
stock_df['HL_PCT'] = (stock_df['Adj. High'] - stock_df['Adj. Close'] ) / stock_df ['Adj. Close'] * 100.0

# Our next features is the Percentage price change obtained by subtracting the adjusted close
# from the adjusted open and dividing  by the adjusted open multiplied by 100.0
stock_df['PCT_change']  = (stock_df['Adj. Close'] - stock_df['Adj. Open']) / stock_df['Adj. Open'] * 100.0 

#print (stock_df.head())
#%save stock_example1.py


# Once we have the features, we want to then get the labels, i.e. for a classifier, we want to know
# whether or not we have a True or a False value. 

# Here we're using the Adjusted close as our label name.  
forecast_col = 'Adj. Close'

# With machine learning, we will replace any NaN values with a real number (even though it's an outlier). 
# This is a better choice than getting rid of columns that don't have all the data. 
stock_df.fillna(-99999, inplace=True)

# Now we'll define our regression algorithm
# Let's first set how many days back we want to go  as a percentage of the number of days in the data frame. 
# Here we'll set it to go back ten percent of the total number of days in the data frame. 
days_back = 0.1 
forecast_out = int(math.ceil(days_back*len(stock_df)))

# Here we use the pandas shift method to shift the forecast label values out by the amount
# specified in the forecast_out variable.  Basically, the label will contain the adjusted close
# value ten days (as specified by the forecast_out variable) into the future. 

stock_df['label'] = stock_df[forecast_col].shift(-forecast_out)
stock_df.dropna(inplace=True)

# Now, from our dataframe, let's get both our test data (X) and our label (y) that we will feed into our 
# linear regression model.  Note that the test
X = np.array(stock_df.drop(['label'],1))
y = np.array(stock_df['label'])

# The preprocessing module from sklearn 'normalizes' our features, that is to say, it tries to 
# make sure that for each feature given, the values range roughly by one unit.  So, for example
# having features range in value between -1 and 1 or =0.5 to 0.5. 
# The reason for doing this is to hopefully speed up the execution of the linear regression algorithm.  

X = preprocessing.scale(X)

# Now, let's get two sets of values.  
# Set 1.  The training data for our linear regression algorithm.
# Set 2.  The testing data to see how well our algorithm learned from the training data. 

# Here we're going to split up the data we got from Quandl for the training feature data (X_train) and the training label data (y_train)
# and the testing feature data (X_test) and the testing label data (y_test)

X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.2)

# Let's choose the SKLearn's Linear Regression algorithnm for our ML example
clf=LinearRegression()

# Let's run the training data through the algorithm. 
clf.fit(X_train,y_train)

# Now let's see how well the training set compares to the testing data. 
accuracy=clf.score(X_test,y_test)

print (accuracy)

# A good result is to have an accuracy of 75 per cent or better (usually rather difficult to
# achieve with real world training sets)",27

a) on the ""preprocessing using the train"" thing, I guess the main thing also is that all sorts of estimates, parameters, etc must eb strictly computed from the training data only, so when you get future data you must re-use the parameters that you learned & saved at the time of training 

b) it would be nice to explain why the accuracy keeps changing everytime you re-run, mentioning the seed in the cross validation process",1

I would just like to point out for those just tickling the subject, the high accuracy output from this model is rather misleading (no flame intended on the content creator, I actually do admire your work and want you to keep making these amazing videos!). The problem occurs when the data is scaled. In practice when you scale training and validation sets together you are introducing a huge bias into your training set from your validation set due to the way the data is scaled. It is as if, when you scale data that way, your training set gets a huge ""peek"" into the future thus resulting on the obscenely high accuracies observed. Just food for thought. Anyway. Great video!

I had some different results when applying the svm.SVR; when the (kernel = 'poly'), Python locked and closed.

Nothing to panic, I will study more to see where the error is.",3

Close which is include as one of the features. basically we are using previous values of our label as an explicative variable. u cant do that in linear regression. u cant use AR models here. So i recommend to drop Adj. Close of your features then u´ll see that the accuary goes down.,0

          Show less",760 Comments,D. Refaeli,6 years ago,"I think the problem of getting high ""accuracy"" (=R^2 coefficient) with using this Linear Regression Model on our data, is due to the fact our label data spans from quite a low number (~50) to quite a high number (~800) and has a very high variance in itself (even for a shuffled test set). It just so happens that stock prices tend to stay in the vicinity of what it used to be - even 30 days after/ago (unless some really crazy things happened and the stock flies up or plunges). So our model variance (Sum of Squared Errors) would be relatively small (compared with the overall label variance). 

So actually our model is not that great, but when calculating the R^2 coefficient which is the ""accuracy"" - the overall variance of our label-data is so great compared with the model variance, that we get a ""good accuracy"". 

If we take, say - only the last 110 days, shift 10, so we have 100 features values, and 100 labels, train it on 80 and test it on 20 - we will get (unsurprisingly) really bad results (when I ran this R^2/Accuracy ~ 0).",86

Firstly I'd thank you for providing us with such fluent tutorials. Your video series is among the best ones I found. It's much more elaborate, practical and useful than Udacity's course on the topic. 

I'd a doubt if you'd like to clarify.
I tried running the code shown here multiple times on my PC. To my astonishment, the accuracy improved each time I reran the code. Can you tell me the reason behind that? Is it so that if we train using the same data multiple times, the machine learns better? Also, I'd wish to know what exactly does preprocessing.scale(X) does and why is it necessary?",0

I wanted to implement neural network with hidden layers, to know some missing items, 
I'm using MLPClassifier
Do you think this is a suitable way for doing this ?

I have a couple of questions:

1)Which books, papers or webpages can you recommend me in order to learn the nitty gritty of the models? I personally feel bad about myself whenever I apply algorithms or mathematical methods without knowing how they work deep inside.
2) Why did you choose, in the cross validation, to set 'test_size' = 0.2?

But one point of feedback i would like to give is that it will probably help to give examples sometimes. Especially when you were using panda shift in the earlier video and also in this video when u were using scaling and  talking about some other specific terms. I think maybe you assumed people would know something about regression or preprocessing before watching ur video but as a person who no idea of linear regression before watching this series, some of the stuff was going over my head and i had to stop do some looking up before proceeding. This was not necessarily a bad thing as i have a good foundation now but maybe something you can call out for others who are looking at your video series.",0

At times, I am confused what's the problem and why we do this or that. For example, I was lost in case of that forecast_col=forecast... Then, in case of X=preprocessing.scale(X)..., Why do we care about that? what are we tryting to achieve by doing this or that, in general whats the goal of this or that exercise. I check other comments and sometimes that helps. Seems, I am not the only one who is confused at times

I see that a lot of people have the above error when trying to fit their model.
It looks like most if not all tried to fit using 
clf=svm.SVC()
that is used for classification problems.
For continuous problems we use regression, hence use
clf=svm.SVR()
The funny thing is, that is clearly explained in sentdex python programming page, but seems nobody is paying attention to that.",0

 `from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split `
and hence `X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)` will fix that.

Also, at around 6:15 the `dropna` function won't do anything to the dataset with default parameters if it has no NaN elements. The forecast shift is something else entirely.

1 more thing - if you're getting NaN values in the array like I was you could use something like `nan_to_num` in numpy or use pandas for this. The below snippet works well: 

```
X = pd.DataFrame(df.drop(['label'], 1))
y = pd.DataFrame(df['label'])
df.dropna(inplace=True)

X = X.fillna(method = 'ffill')
y = y.fillna(method = 'ffill')

However, since he is not using Python, I am following this series to understand the implementation in python. Combining both of these courses is a very deadly combination. I learn how everything is working from Andrew and implementing these algorithms is what I learn from these videos. I think that just going on with on thing is going to be difficult as you will either not understand the mathematical working our you might miss out on the implementation.",0

So is there any way to calculate night logout timings.  Cheers for your efforts. Ur innovative tips are truly helpful",0

I have tried many videos but nothing could make me stick to the chair to learn seriously. In your video, it is a different experience. I could start and follow the video step by step and complete the lessons effortlessly. I completed only 45 minutes of your video that engaged me for at least 4 hours but it has been an exciting experience. I heard of your Facebook group and shall certainly join  this and bother you with all my doubts. Thanking you, once again, this is Prabhakara Rao, very proud to be from India.",10

I have 2 questions: why are we downloading xampp the local host for wordpress I mean in what way it's going to be of use compared to if we simply open the wordpress page in our browser and login with our email?

Question 2: even if we download xampp and everything as you've just shown how can we login to the page we already have using xampp database

Thank you and have a great day!",0

it seems it has to do with a permission issue, so i found out about filezilla, and tried to use it to change the permission to 755 or 777 but whenever i attempt to do it i get ""500 wrong command""

and i cant even log in the filezilla and xampp forums to ask about this, cause the verification e-mail is never sent to any e-mail i attempt to use to register.

help i tried everything i could think of =/",0

			INTRODUCTION
1.SQL is a technical language which is used to access and interact with Relational DBMS.
2.A Relational DBMS is simply a software application which is used to create and manage databases.
3.MySQL is one of the most popular and basic example of Relational database software.
	Some other examples include Oracle,postgreSQL,mariaDB
4.Some examples of non-relaional database softwares are mongoDB,dynamoDB,apache cassandra,firebase.
5.A database is a collection of similar type of data stored in various forms.
6.A DBMS is a special software program which is used to create and manage databases
	..>Maintain huge amounts of data
	..>Create backups
	..>Provide Security
	..>Import/Export Data
	..>Concurrency
	..>Also interacts with various software applications using different programming languages. 
7.C.R.U.D is an ancronym which stands for Create Read/Retrieve Update Delete. These 4 major operations are often performed on databases
8.Majorly 2 types of databases:-
Relational:- a)Data is organized systematically in one or two tables
	     b)Data is organized into rows,columns
	     c)Every row has a unique key
Non-Relational:-Anything which is not rational(traditional tables)
	        a)Flexible tables
		b)Key-value stores
		c)Documents
		d)Graphs
9.Structured Query Language
..>Standardized language for interacting with RDBMS
..>Used for creating tables and structures
..>Used to perform C.R.U.D operations on databases along with other administrative tasks(user management,security,backup)
..>SQL code used on one RDBMS cannot always be portable to other RDBMS without slight modification. 
10.Queries are requests made to the DBMS for specific information
   ..>Complex the DataBase Structure-Harder to acquire the wanted pieces of information
   ..>EX:-A google search is a query 

    		 TABLES AND KEYS
11.Columns=Attributes
   Rows=Entries
12.Every table has a primary key. A primary key is an special attribute which uniquely defines every row.
13.Surrogate key is a type of primary key which has no mapping to anything in the real world.(Food-id)
14.A natural key is a type of primary key which has a mapping or relation with the entry in real world(Ex:-Aadhar Number)
15.Foreign key is a special attribute which links the entries of one table with another table in the form of primary key.
   Defines the relationship between two tables.
   A foreign key may also link the relationships among entries of the same table. 
16.Sometimes,one primary key may have to specify two rows with same value.
   To solve that we use composite key which is a combination of two primary keys.
   In a composite key,a single primary key cannot uniquely identify each entry of the table,but when two primary keys are put together they can uniquely identify each key.
   No two corresonding values in a composite key are same.
17.Sometimes two primary keys of a composite key maybe foreign keys(linking to as other tables' primary keys).
		SQL BASICS
18.SQL is basically a hybrid language basically stuffed with 4 different types of languages:-
	1.Data Query Language(DQL)
		..>Used for querying some specific information(which is already stored in the database)
	2.Data Definition Language(DML)
		..>Used for defining data base schemas
	3.Data Control Language(DCL)
		..>Used for managing the access of data 
		..>used in administrative tasks(user management,security,backup)
	4.Data Manipulation Language(DML)
		..>Used to perform C.R.U.D operations on databases
 		
19.PopSQL is a modern SQL editor which is majorly being used these days on teams.It allows employees to write/submit sql queries,share the results and visualize the data.

		Create Tables
20.The Core SQL Data Types Are:-
				INT-Whole Number
				Decimal(M,N)-Exact Decimal Value{M represents total digits and N represents total digits after the decimal point}
				VARCHAR(n)-A textual string with a maximum of n characters
				BLOB-Large Binary Object used to store large data
				DATE-'YYYY-MM-DD'
				TIMESTAMP-'YYYY-MM-DD' 'HH-MM-SS'

21.			BASIC OPERATIONS
a)Create a table
b)Describe the table
b)Delete(Drop) a table
c)Specifying the PRIMARY KEY
d)Alter a table i.e add a column
e)Alter a table i.e delete a column
f)INSERT INTO
g)INSERT INTO (only some attributes to be filled)
...>Note:-We have two ways of avoiding writing a value{directly and indirectly}
          {Directly means writing NULL while filling values. Indirectly means skipping that unwanted attribute while writing the attributes names in () beside table_name while filling the values} 
h)SELECT * FROM 
 Note:-No Duplicate Entries Under the Primary Key
 Note:-DESCRIBE,INSERT INTO and SELECT need not be written with TABLE keyword


22.			CONSTRAINTS
...>These are written besides the attribute name while specifying
a)NOT NULL {You will have to fill up that attribute}
b)UNIQUE   {All values under that attribute will have to be different from each other}
c)DEFAULT ''{When you indirectly don't fill up an attribute,it will automatically fill up that space with default ''} 
Note:-A primary key is by nature NOT NULL and UNIQUE
d)AUTO_INCREMENT {When specified beside any attribute,it will automatically assign 1,2,3,4... but you will have to indirectly skip that attribute while filling values}

23.			UPDATE AND DELETE
a)UPDATE tablename
  SET name='Imran'
  WHERE name='Uzair'
Note:-We can also update value under an attribute with the reference of value under another attribute(as shown below)
b)UPDATE student
  SET major='java'
  WHERE student_id=5
c)We can update value for multiple references using OR
d)We can update multiple values for single/multiple references using ,
e)We can update all values under an attribute as a common single value.
Note:-You can use OR and AND in WHERE but only AND in SET  {here AND in SET should be denoted using comma only}
 
f)DELETE FROM student
  WHERE name='faiz';
Note:-You can use OR and AND in WHERE
g)WHERE is like if condition in programming whereas SET is like the set of instruction you want to execute.The condition is also called prompt.
			BASIC QUERIES
a)To rename a table
                   RENAME TABLE old_table_name TO new_table_name;
b)To print selected columns
			   SELECT table_name.column_name
			   FROM table_name;
c)To print multiple selected columns
			   SELECT table_name.column_name,table_name.column_name
			   FROM table_name;
d)Along with printing a column or columns you can also arrange the values of an attribute in ascending or descending order
			   SELECT column_name,column_name
			   FROM table_name
			   ORDER BY column_name;  {Ascending Order}

			   SELECT column_name,column_name
			   FROM table_name
			   ORDER BY column_name DESC;  {Descending Order} 
e)Along with printing column or columns you can also arrange multiple columns in ascending or descending order
			   SELECT column_name,column_name
			   FROM table_name
			   ORDER BY column_name,column_name;  {Ascending Order(The first mentioned column will be sorted and if it contains any 2 same values,they will be sorted w.r.t second column order}
 Note:-Ascending/Descending does not apply to integers
f)You can impose a limit on number of rows you want to print
	             	   SELECT column_name
			   FROM table_name
			   LIMIT 2;			      {You can also order if you wish}
g)Till now we printed desired columns,we printed in an order using ORDER BY and then we also imposed a limit  
  Now we will print only those columns which satisfy a particular condition
			   SELECT column_name,column_name
			   FROM table_name
			   WHERE column_name='' AND column_name<5;  {You can use >,<,>=,<=,=,<>}
h)Insted of = you can use IN('','')
			   SELECT column_names
			   FROM table_name
			   WHERE column_name IN ('value1','value2','value3')
i)Along with printing selected columns of a table you can change the name of those selected columns to be printed in the output
			   SELECT first_name AS fore_name,last_name AS sur_name
			   FROM employee;
j)To know the various categories of values under a particular column
			   SELECT DISTINCT sex
 			   FROM employee;

			SCHEMA
a)A database schema is a skeleton structure of the database that represents the logical view of the entire database.
b)A parent table is the one which includes the foreign key.
c)A child table is the one that has the attribute to which the parent table's foreign key refers.
d)To specify a foreign key,we do it inside CREATE TABLE table_name(
							           FOREIGN KEY attribute_name REFERS child_table_name(attrribute_name) ON DELETE SET NULL
									);
e)ON DELETE SET NULL{on deleting of a row in parent table,the value in child table w.r.t foreign key becomes NULL}
f)e)ON DELETE CASCADE{on deleting of a row in parent table,the corresponding row in child table gets deleted}

        After creating child table,you may add foreign key for the parent table by ALTER TABLE table_name ADD attribute_name data_type; 	
      b)In the parent table,do not fill the values for foreign key.Better fill the foreign keys initially as NULL.
        After filling values in child table,UPDATE the foreign key values of parent table.
Note:-You cannot DROP(delete) the parent table without deleting the child table.
			FUNCTIONS

I am 64 and I see that you are young. Hats off to you for being young and able to teach people like me in a manner and language that I understand easily. I am also simultaneously studying your SQL tutorial. Kudos to you for repeating concepts to underline and drill them in. After so many attempts, I have finally understood the foreign key concept. With you learning is fun and progress can be measured.Keep up the good work.  I cannot thank you enough for making learning a pleasant task.",0

For the people who cannot find how to connect the newest popSQL with your mySQL database.

(from popSQL) file > Preferences > Connections > Add new connection > mySQL
