The market has done very little during the trading session on Thursday as we continue to hang around the 50-Day EMA.

The Bitcoin market needs cheap money to get moving and of course risk appetite.

Risk appetite is a situation where we are waiting to see cheap money coming out of the Federal Reserve, and therefore it's likely that we will be reading every statement and every little economic announcement as a potential mover for Bitcoin.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2022-10/07/DF_b483aimage_story.jpg,,8.054408

Credit Suisse's CDS spread is at levels not seen since 2009.
Deutsche Bank's price per share has averaged 0.3 times tangible book value (TBV).

The financial world is buzzing about Credit Suisse. The recent increase in Credit Suisse's credit default swap spread has garnered media attention. A credit default swap, or CDS, is a kind of derivative that enables one investor to hedge against another's credit risk by exchanging their own credit risk for that of the other. 
Lenders may hedge their bets by purchasing credit default swaps (CDS) from investors who have already agreed to compensate them if the borrower fails.",recentlyheard.com,43766,news,unknown,en,"Rajesh Khanna,https:",https://recentlyheard.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CoinPayments-Announces-Shutting-Down-Operations-Amid-Crypto-Winter.jpg?is-pending-load=1,,7.767146

 Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fell Friday after U.S. economic data revealed that the labor market remains strong—potentially paving the way for even more aggressive monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. The price of Bitcoin has fallen 2.5% over the past 24 hours to below $19,800 immediately after the release of the nonfarm payrolls report for September. The largest digital asset had previously been trading around $20,000, a level at which it has floated for much of the period since a mid-June selloff drove the largest digital asset down from $30,000.",barrons.com,1377,finance,US,en,Jack Denton,https://images.barrons.com/im-489169/social,@BarronsOnline,7.760065

High difficulty (resulting from high hashing power), as is currently the case, tends to reduce the profitability of miners.",oltnews.com,57922,news,unknown,en,,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1324841462/image_1324841462.jpg?io=getty-c-w750,,7.6311717

Bitcoin miners are supposed to be the bulls of last resort, but how are their financials faring in this bitcoin price tumble? Buy low then sell high is one of the most basic components of investment advice in the history of financial markets. Bitcoin is now 10 months into its current bear market cycle , and plenty of investors and companies that didn't 'sell high' are probably regretting it. Miners stand apart from all other market participants, however, because they are in effect always buying (paying for electricity to earn more bitcoin) and, depending on their corporate strategy, always selling, too (selling bitcoin to pay for capital expenses and operating costs).",bitrss.com,526564,news,unknown,en,BitRss.com,https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1664813284_56999226.png,@RssBit,7.3766236

A closely followed crypto strategist and trader is issuing a warning to Bitcoin holders that BTC could witness a big capitulation event amid weakness in the stock market. Pseudonymous trader Cantering Clark tells his 146,700 Twitter followers that Bitcoin could witness a drop of nearly 40% from current levels if the S&P 500 (SPX) continues its bearish streak. 'If the S&P 500 drops down to the next major region between 3200-3400 [points], I think the right assumption would be that crypto beta would be at least 2-3x that, which at a minimum means Bitcoin retests the ledge of the highest volume node of the last five years – so around $12,000-$13,000.",bitrss.com,526564,news,unknown,en,BitRss.com,https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1664748552_93479785.jpg,@RssBit,7.1499934

Miners are essential for the well-functioning of a blockchain because they bring in computational power. This power is used for processing transactions, as well as for allocating newly-created tokens. With cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, when a new block is created, new BTC tokens are created as a reward.
These are some of the core principles behind Proof-of-Work (PoW), a popular consensus mechanism that's constantly criticized for its energy use and ultimately, the impact on the environment.",techbullion.com,17709,news,US,en,"Angela Scott-Briggs,Umesh Kumar",https://techbullion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/crypto-jj-960x600.jpg,@TechBullion,6.867894

Cryptocurrencies have long been fairytale climate villains using ever-increasing amounts of power, seemingly only to make a few people rich. Now the story has taken a new turn. The world's second biggest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has announced a change to its multi-billion dollar business that should reduce its total energy use by over 99%.

Or will everything go back to normal when the clock strikes twelve?
